# 🌍 Exploitation Basics: My Journey with TryHackMe  

The **Exploitation Basics** module on TryHackMe introduces the art of exploitation through real-world vulnerabilities and frameworks.  
Through hands-on labs, I learned to leverage vulnerabilities, use the Metasploit framework, and understand post-exploitation techniques in controlled environments.

Here's my documentation of each room I've completed 👇

## ⚔️ Room 7: Exploitation Basics  

**Description:**  
This room provided hands-on experience with real-world exploitation techniques, from leveraging specific CVEs to mastering the Metasploit framework for comprehensive penetration testing.

### 🔗 Moniker Link (CVE-2024-21413)  
- 💻 **What I did:** Exploited CVE-2024-21413 to leak user credentials by bypassing Outlook's Protected View.  
- 🚀 **Takeaway:** Even modern security features like Protected View can have vulnerabilities that attackers exploit.  
- 📝 **Skills gained:**  
  - Understanding CVE exploitation methodology  
  - Bypassing email security controls  
  - Credential harvesting techniques  

---

### 🛠️ Metasploit: Introduction  
- 🔧 **What I did:** Learned the main components and architecture of the Metasploit Framework.  
- 🚀 **Takeaway:** Metasploit is a comprehensive penetration testing platform that standardizes exploitation workflows.  
- 📝 **Skills gained:**  
  - Metasploit framework architecture  
  - Module types and functionality  
  - Basic msfconsole navigation  

---

### 🎯 Metasploit: Exploitation  
- 🔍 **What I did:** Used Metasploit for scanning, vulnerability assessment, and active exploitation.  
- 🚀 **Takeaway:** Systematic vulnerability scanning and exploitation requires proper methodology and tool mastery.  
- 📝 **Skills gained:**  
  - Target scanning and enumeration  
  - Exploit selection and configuration  
  - Payload generation and delivery  

---

### 👻 Metasploit: Meterpreter  
- 🕵️ **What I did:** Deep dive into Meterpreter for advanced post-exploitation using in-memory payloads.  
- 🚀 **Takeaway:** Post-exploitation is where the real value lies in penetration testing and red team operations.  
- 📝 **Skills gained:**  
  - Meterpreter session management  
  - In-memory payload advantages  
  - Post-exploitation enumeration and persistence  

---

### 💙 Blue  
- 🖥️ **What I did:** Deployed and hacked into a Windows machine by leveraging common misconfiguration issues.  
- 🚀 **Takeaway:** Many successful attacks exploit basic misconfigurations rather than complex zero-day vulnerabilities.  
- 📝 **Skills gained:**  
  - Windows vulnerability assessment  
  - Common misconfiguration exploitation  
  - Full attack chain execution

📌 **Reflection on this Room:**  
The **Exploitation Basics** room provided practical experience with real-world attack scenarios.  
It demonstrated how vulnerabilities are discovered, assessed, and exploited while emphasizing the importance of understanding both offensive and defensive perspectives.
