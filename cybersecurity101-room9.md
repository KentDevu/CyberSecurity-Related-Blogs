# 🌍 Offensive Security Tooling: My Journey with TryHackMe  

The **Offensive Security Tooling** module on TryHackMe introduced me to essential red team tools and attack methodologies.  
Through practical exercises, I learned to use powerful tools for password attacks, directory enumeration, shell techniques, and database exploitation.

Here's my documentation of each room I've completed 👇

## ⚔️ Room 9: Offensive Security Tooling  

**Description:**  
This room provided hands-on experience with essential penetration testing tools used by security professionals for vulnerability assessment and ethical hacking.

### 💀 Hydra  
- 💻 **What I did:** Mastered Hydra for conducting brute-force attacks against various network services and protocols.  
- 🚀 **Takeaway:** Automated password attacks can quickly compromise weak authentication systems across multiple services.  
- 📝 **Skills gained:**  
  - Multi-protocol brute-force attacks (SSH, FTP, HTTP, etc.)  
  - Wordlist management and optimization  
  - Parallelized attack configuration  
  - Service-specific attack parameters  

---

### 🔍 Gobuster: The Basics  
- 🛠 **What I did:** Learned directory and file enumeration using Gobuster for web application reconnaissance.  
- 🚀 **Takeaway:** Hidden directories and files often contain sensitive information or additional attack vectors.  
- 📝 **Skills gained:**  
  - Directory brute-forcing techniques  
  - Custom wordlist creation and usage  
  - File extension enumeration  
  - Recursive directory scanning  

---

### 🐚 Shells Overview  
- 🔧 **What I did:** Explored different types of shells, their characteristics, and methods for establishing remote access.  
- 🚀 **Takeaway:** Understanding shell types is crucial for maintaining persistence and navigating compromised systems effectively.  
- 📝 **Skills gained:**  
  - Reverse vs bind shell concepts  
  - Shell stabilization techniques  
  - Interactive vs non-interactive shells  
  - Shell upgrade and improvement methods  

---

### 💉 SQLMap: The Basics  
- ⚔️ **What I did:** Learned automated SQL injection testing and database exploitation using SQLMap.  
- 🚀 **Takeaway:** Automated tools can quickly identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities that manual testing might miss.  
- 📝 **Skills gained:**  
  - Automated SQL injection detection  
  - Database enumeration and data extraction  
  - WAF bypass techniques  
  - Custom payload and tamper script usage  

---

📌 **Reflection on this Room:**  
The **Offensive Security Tooling** room equipped me with essential red team tools that form the backbone of modern penetration testing.  
Each tool serves a specific purpose in the attack chain, from initial reconnaissance to post-exploitation activities.
