# 🚀 My Journey Into Cybersecurity with TryHackMe’s Pre-Security Path  

Cybersecurity has always fascinated me — how attackers break systems, how defenders protect them, and how technology plays both sides of the game.  

But before learning to hack or defend, I needed to understand **how technology actually works**.  
That’s when I found the **Pre-Security Learning Path on TryHackMe**.  

This beginner-friendly path gave me the foundation to step into the cybersecurity world with confidence.  
And here’s how my journey went... 👇

## 🛡️ Section 1: Introduction to Cyber Security  

My first stop was understanding the **bigger picture**:  

- 🔴 **Offensive Security** – how attackers think & exploit.  
- 🔵 **Defensive Security** – how defenders detect & protect.  
- 🧑‍💻 **Careers in Cyber** – a peek into the many paths in this field.  

It made me realize cybersecurity isn’t just about hacking — it’s a world of **strategy, puzzles, and digital battles**.  

---

## 🌐 Section 2: Network Fundamentals  

Networking is the **backbone of cybersecurity**. Without it, you can’t understand how data flows (or gets intercepted).  

I explored:  
- 🌍 **What Networking Is** – how devices “talk” to each other.  
- 🏠 **LANs** – small networks inside bigger ones.  
- 🗂 **OSI Model** – the 7-layer cake of communication.  
- 📦 **Packets & Frames** – the envelopes of the internet.  
- 🔗 **Extending Networks** – scaling with switches & routers.  

Suddenly, the internet didn’t feel like “magic” anymore — it felt like **organized chaos** that I could finally read.  

---

## 🌍 Section 3: How The Web Works  

The web is everywhere, but here’s what I really learned:  

- 📖 **DNS in Detail** – the phonebook of the internet.  
- 🌐 **HTTP in Detail** – the rules of the web.  
- 🏗 **How Websites Work** – front-end, back-end, the whole machine.  
- 🧩 **Putting It All Together** – watching a single request travel across layers.  

Now, every time I type a URL, I know the **journey behind the scenes**.  

---

## 🐧 Section 4: Linux Fundamentals  

Linux looked scary at first, but it quickly became my favorite tool.  

- 📂 File navigation  
- ⚙️ Permissions & processes  
- 🔑 Power of the command line  

```bash
# Example: listing files with details
ls -la
```

I realized **Linux is the hacker’s playground and the defender’s toolkit**.  

---

## 🪟 Section 5: Windows Fundamentals  

Not everything is Linux — so I also dove into **Windows internals**:  

- 👤 User accounts & permissions  
- 📁 File systems & registry basics  
- ⚡ Processes & task management  

Since most businesses rely on Windows, this section was a reality check:  
**Attackers love Windows, so defenders must master it.**  

---

## 💡 Reflection: Why This Path Mattered  

The Pre-Security path wasn’t just “the basics” — it was my **cybersecurity foundation**.  
It gave me clarity, confidence, and curiosity.  

Now when I see an exploit demo, I don’t just watch — I **understand the gears turning behind the scenes**.  

---

## 🎯 What’s Next?  

Finishing Pre-Security is just **Level 1 unlocked**. Next, I’m aiming for:  

- 🔐 **Jr. Penetration Tester Path**  
- 🛰 **SOC Level 1**  
- 🛡 **Red Teaming**  

This is just the start of my cybersecurity story.  
With each TryHackMe room, I’m not just learning...  
I’m **leveling up**. 🎮
