# ‚öîÔ∏è Snort Challenge - Live Attacks: Defending Against Real Threats

> *"Put your snort skills into practice and defend against a live attack"* ‚Äî TryHackMe

This advanced challenge took my Snort skills to the next level by defending **J&Y Enterprise** against real-time cyber attacks. Unlike analyzing static packet captures, I had to detect and **actively block** live malicious traffic using Snort's Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) capabilities.

---

## üéØ Mission Overview

**The Setting:** J&Y Enterprise - a world-renowned tech-coffee shop chain known for unique IT-themed recipes like "WannaWhite," "ZeroSleep," and their super-secret "Shot4J" recipe.

**The Threat:** Attackers are targeting their digital assets, and I was called in to implement real-time protection using Snort IPS.

**My AI Assistant:** J.A.V.A. (Just Another Virtual Assistant) helped identify anomalies and coordinate the defense.

## üö® Scenario 1: SSH Brute-Force Attack

### **The Alert**
> **J.A.V.A.:** *"We have a brute-force attack, sir. Somebody is knocking on the door!"*

### **Investigation Phase**

#### Step 1: Traffic Capture & Analysis
```bash
# Start Snort in sniffer mode to capture live traffic
sudo snort -v -l .
```

**Duration:** Ran for 10-15 seconds to capture attack traffic
**Result:** Generated `snort.log.1672414629` with suspicious activity

#### Step 2: Log Analysis
```bash
# Read captured packets in detail
sudo snort -r snort.log.1672414629 -X

# Search for specific port patterns
sudo snort -r snort.log.1672414629 -X | grep :22

# Look for SSH-specific indicators  
sudo snort -r snort.log.1672414629 -X | grep "ssh"
```

**Key Discovery:** Extensive traffic targeting **port 22** (SSH service)

#### Step 3: Packet Inspection
```bash
# Examine first 30 packets for detailed analysis
sudo snort -r snort.log.1672414629 -X -n 30
```

**Attack Pattern Identified:**
- **Service:** SSH (Secure Shell)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Port:** 22
- **Attack Type:** Brute-force login attempts

### **Defense Implementation**

#### Step 4: IPS Rule Creation
```bash
# Open Snort rules configuration
sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
```

**Critical Rule Written:**
```bash
drop tcp any 22 <> any any (msg:"SSH Connection attempted"; sid:100001; rev:1;)
```

**Rule Breakdown:**
- `drop` - **Block** traffic instead of just alerting
- `tcp any 22 <> any any` - Bidirectional TCP traffic on port 22
- `msg` - Descriptive alert message
- `sid:100001` - Unique rule identifier

#### Step 5: Live Attack Blocking
```bash
# Deploy IPS in full protection mode
sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q -Q --daq afpacket -i eth0:eth1 -A full
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ **Attack Successfully Blocked!**
- **Flag Retrieved:** `THM{81b7fef657f8aaa6e4e200d616738254}`
- **Attack Duration:** Blocked within 1 minute of rule deployment

---

## üîÑ Scenario 2: Reverse Shell Detection

### **The Discovery**
> **J.A.V.A.:** *"Persistent outbound traffic detected. Possibly a reverse shell..."*

### **Investigation Phase**

#### Step 1: Outbound Traffic Analysis  
```bash
# Capture suspicious outbound communications
sudo snort -v -l .
```

**Focus:** Investigating **insider threats** and **persistent outbound connections**

#### Step 2: Traffic Pattern Analysis
```bash
# Analyze captured traffic
sudo snort -r snort.log.1672697486 -X

# Search for suspicious port usage
sudo snort -r snort.log.1672697486 -X | grep ":4444"

# Examine packet details
sudo snort -r snort.log.1672697486 -X -n 10
```

**Attack Pattern Identified:**
- **Port:** 4444 (Common reverse shell port)
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Behavior:** Persistent outbound connections
- **Tool Association:** Metasploit framework

### **Defense Implementation**

#### Step 3: Reverse Shell Rule Creation
```bash
# Create blocking rule for reverse shell traffic
drop tcp any 4444 <> any any (msg:"Reverse Shell Detected"; sid:100001; rev:1;)
```

#### Step 4: Active Prevention
```bash
# Deploy IPS to block reverse shell communications
sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q -Q --daq afpacket -i eth0:eth1 -A full
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ **Reverse Shell Successfully Blocked!**
- **Flag Retrieved:** `THM{0ead8c494861079b1b74ec2380d2cd24}`
- **Communication Severed:** Malicious outbound connection terminated

## üéì Technical Skills Demonstrated

### **Live Traffic Analysis:**
- **Real-time packet capture** during active attacks
- **Pattern recognition** for identifying attack signatures  
- **Protocol analysis** for TCP/SSH and reverse shell communications
- **Port-based threat detection** (22, 4444)

### **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):**
- **Rule-based blocking** instead of passive alerting
- **Bidirectional traffic control** using `<>` operators
- **Live deployment** of protection rules
- **Real-time threat mitigation**

### **Advanced Snort Usage:**
```bash
# Sniffer mode with logging
sudo snort -v -l .

# Detailed packet analysis  
sudo snort -r logfile -X -n [count]

# Pattern searching with grep integration
sudo snort -r logfile -X | grep "pattern"

# IPS deployment with DAQ
sudo snort -c config -q -Q --daq afpacket -i interfaces -A full
```
