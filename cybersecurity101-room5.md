# 🌍 Networking Fundamentals: My Journey with TryHackMe  

The **Networking Fundamentals** module on TryHackMe explores the OSI model, TCP/IP layers, and various networking protocols.  
Through hands-on labs, I learned about plaintext and secure protocols, network analysis tools, and how data flows across networks in our daily digital interactions.

Here's my documentation of each room I've completed 👇
